# CalHacks 5.0 (Fall 2018) Containerization Workshop Demo Code

This repository contains a simple Flask application (app.py) and a Dockerfile
that packages and executes the application through `gunicorn`. It is controlled
by means of a Makefile, so you will need to have `make` installed, along with
a reasonably recent Docker runtime and Python 3.

After cloning the repository, one can edit `app.py` to modify the behavior of
the application, and use `make dev` to launch the development server listening
on `127.0.0.1:5000`. Once one is ready to "deploy" the application, one can do
so by running `make docker-run`, which builds and executes an ephemeral container
to run the application, listening on port 5000, or by using `make build` and
manipulating the resulting file oneself afterwards.

Dependencies:
* Docker runtime
* Python 3(.5)
* GNU Make
